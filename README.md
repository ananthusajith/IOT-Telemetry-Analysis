# Prediction of Environment Using Environmental Sensor Telemetry Data
This project is regarding the digital assessment for the course Wireless Adhoc and Sensor Networks where I've employed six different machine learning techniques to perform data analysis of a IOT Telemtry dataset.

The data was generated from a series of three identical, custom-built, breadboardbased sensor arrays. Each array was connected to a Raspberry Pi devices. Each of the
three IoT devices was placed in a physical location with varied environmental conditions.

##Device Environmental Conditions
00:0f:00:70:91:0a stable conditions, cooler and more humid
1c:bf:ce:15:ec:4d highly variable temperature and humidity
b8:27:eb:bf:9d:51 stable conditions, warmer and dryer

Each IoT device collected a total of seven different readings from the four sensors on
a regular interval. Sensor readings include temperature, humidity, carbon monoxide
(CO), liquid petroleum gas (LPG), smoke, light, and motion. The data spans the
period from 07/12/2020 00:00:00 UTC â€“ 07/19/2020 23:59:59 UTC.
There is a total of 405,184 rows of data.
The sensor readings, along with a unique device ID and timestamp, were published as
a single message, using the ISO standard Message Queuing Telemetry Transport
(MQTT) network protocol.
